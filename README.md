# E6data-Hackathon
Duration: 6 hours 
Challenge: Build a custom query engine to process a dataset of millions of taxi trip records. The engine must support filtering, projection, aggregation, and group-by operations without relying on external data processing engines (e.g., DuckDB, Polars, Pandas, Spark, Hadoop, etc.) for reading the JSON file.

Important:

File Reader Requirement: The file reading code must be completely custom built. While you can use external libraries for processing the data after the file is read, you are not allowed to use them for parsing or reading the JSON files.

Dataset Download: You can download the dataset from the following link (make
sure to unzip it before use): taxi-trips-data.json.zip
